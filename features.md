# CTA Features

Compass Test Automation (CTA) is the answer to the following questions:

## How can I test my code?
CTA allows you to easily on-board your tests, run them and get their results
To this end, you can either run your test on our VMs or onboard your own system
All it will take is for your framework to use one of the existing adapter to send status to CTA or to develop one that will benefit others

## How can I onboard my tests with my specific test framework?
Any test framework can send back status using our REST API for Test Framework Integrator

CTA provides you with a visual and real-time report of your results
Access to all logs and dumped data your tests produced is available from CTA
